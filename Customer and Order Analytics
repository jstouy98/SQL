--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(Quantity) AS Number_of_January_Orders FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Quantity) AS Number_of_January_iPhone_Orders FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product = 'iPhone' AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers customers INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price) AS Price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' GROUP BY Product

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, price*Quantity AS Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) AS customers, avg(Quantity*price) AS Average_spent FROM BIT_DB.Febsales FebSales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2 AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
