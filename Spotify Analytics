--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to insert the Spotify data into, and then performed analytics on the data using SQL.

--Create the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. 

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--First I determined what the top 10 songs are by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10

--Second I determined who the top 10 artists are by average popularity.
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10

--Next I determined the average danceability, energy, and duration in ms by artist.
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability, AVG(energy) AS average_energy, AVG(duration_ms) AS average_duration_in_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name

--Lastly I determined which artist released the longest song. 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, MAX(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
